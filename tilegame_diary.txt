IN MIND

And
 Always run server from root like github pages does. Have useful dir with html and symlink to target dir to locally see latest-built version.
 Update link

Immediate improvements to show off to people
 Instructions on opening splash screen

Improvements/towards game
 Improve placeholder art
 Some art
 Animation/sliding during movement
 Hero move then enemies move.
  First logically.
  Then delay in display.
 Puzzles
 Simple plot.

Maybe
 Dialogue
 Way to display dialogue
 Icons for people talking in dialogue

Improving what's there
 Add test for movement.
 Add a few different types of enemy logic.

And
 Alternatives for mouse controls?
 Measure frame rate?
 Get working properly on windows, or some other quick way to test it. (Maybe building wasm on windows?)

Needed at some point
 Try hosting .js too rather than relying on macroquad's version?

GAMEPLAY

In mind:
 Security doors which close when robots get near
 Access doors which open when robots get near
 Gawpie fish
 Another more aggressive fish
 Try out fish with "sparks", bad wiring, that is deadly (?)

Implement some of those
Then put in some simple levels about them.

UI

IMPLEMENT

Tests

IMPROVING CODE

Better ways of storing objects.
 Refcell or Rc to have pointer back to map from objects.
 Or otherwise avoid needing handles.

TESTS

Pass load_stage as argument to Play, or have a "Stages" type, so that you can identify "which game to load" not only which level.
 Make it possible to test "next level" stuff.
