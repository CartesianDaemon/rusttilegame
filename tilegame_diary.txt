IN MIND

Add test for movement.
Add a few different types of enemy logic.
Consider different timing, e.g. player move off-beat then enemies. Go back to "move when you do". Try to find a compromise? E.g. Show "ghost" of where things will move to
Make hero human-ish, enemies animal-ish
Better font. Update look of doors etc.
Draw some simple images in vector, and in background colours, for enemies etc.
Think about simple plot.

And
 Measure frame rate?

Wasm [Works in VM!. Needs proper webserver e.g. basic-http-server. Now..]
 Try on web!
 Try on phone!
 Try on windows. Can serve webserver or not?

GAMEPLAY

In mind:
 Security doors which close when robots get near
 Access doors which open when robots get near
 Gawpie fish
 Another more aggressive fish
 Try out fish with "sparks", bad wiring, that is deadly (?)

Implement some of those
Then put in some simple levels about them.

UI

Clock based or not.
Have immediate feedback when you move to show something is happening.
Decide what order of player/enemy is simplest.

IMPLEMENT

Tests

REFACTORING

More coord types.
Try using refcell to have back-references to map.
Move body of advance function into load. Towards making that independent.

Streamline implementation of movs. But only when it's immediately useful.

Tests.

Pass load_stage as argument to Play, or have a "Stages" type, so that you can identify "which game to load" not only which level.
 Make it possible to test "next level" stuff.
