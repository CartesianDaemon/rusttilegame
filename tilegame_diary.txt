GAMEPLAY

In mind:
 Security doors which close when robots get near
 Access doors which open when robots get near
 Gawpie fish
 Another more aggressive fish
 Try out fish with "sparks", bad wiring, that is deadly (?)

Implement some of those
Then put in some simple levels about them.

Tests

REFACTORING

More coord types.
Try using refcell to have back-references to map.
Move body of advance function into load. Towards making that independent.

Streamline implementation of movs. But only when it's immediately useful.
