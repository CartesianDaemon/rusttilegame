# Rust Tile Game

An experiment in learning rust and designing a game engine for a tile-based puzzle game.

Inspired by my previous projects, cartesianventure and fanangerie.

Envisaged as a meld between classic puzzle games like Chip's Challenge and Repton, and modern puzzle games. To have active, moving enemies, but not to rely on dexterity. And to have the puzzle be more in the enemy's behaviour not in static objects.

In a future where humanity has vanished and goofy well-meaning robots have taken over, an eccentric young biologist has been resurrected to explain why their ecosystem isn't working. Can she convince them that building an ecosystem out of robot animals is impossible, or will she quest across a city of malfunctioning robot animals and make an optimistic future?
