# Rust Tile Game

An experiment in learning rust and designing a game engine for a tile-based puzzle game.

Inspired by my previous projects, cartesianventure and fanangerie.

Envisaged as a meld between classic puzzle games like Chip's Challenge and Repton, and modern puzzle games. To have active, moving enemies, but not to rely on dexterity. And to have the puzzle be more in the enemy's behaviour not in static objects.

In a future where humanity has vanished and goofy well-meaning robots have taken over, an eccentric young biologist has been resurrected to explain why their ecosystem isn't working. Can she convince them that building an ecosystem out of robot animals is impossible, or will she quest across a city of malfunctioning robot animals and make an optimistic future?

Play a working prototype online at: <a href=https://cartesiandaemon.github.io/rusttilegame/wasm/tilegame.html>cartesiandaemon.github.io/rusttilegame/wasm/tilegame.html</a> The current version needs a keyboard to control it, and has only been tested one device, but otherwise runs successfully in a desktop browser and in a mobile browser. Press any key to start, move the hero with the arrow keys, avoid the fish, and try to reach the gold door.

It's good to know if it doesn't load at all, or if it fails to run. There will be lots of small things that haven't been implemented though.
